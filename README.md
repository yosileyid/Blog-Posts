# Blog-Posts

![how-to-write-a-blog-post](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14003326/217071909-471b0d53-d1f9-463e-827c-e5a989bdc32c.png)

This is a repo to create and keep blog posts instead of using Gists before I post them to Dev.to, I like to do it this way.... Github provides a nice way to organize and keep track of repos called "Projects". You can click on Projects here and view an example of how to use a project to organize and keep track of issues in a repo. If you notice a typo on one of my posts, please raise an issue so I can keep track of it and update. Since these are all done in simple `markdown` I like to label issues as #good-first-issue so newbies can feel free to fork and clone this repo and send me a pull request to change it. If you need help please reach out to me on one of my socials and I am more than willing to help.
