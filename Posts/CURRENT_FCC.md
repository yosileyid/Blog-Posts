# FreeCodeCamp Current Course List and Projects (February 2023)

![freecodecamp-head](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14003326/216845732-8a284edb-b2ad-4206-9012-6a56755541d4.png)

These are the projects needed to complete the @FreeCodeCamp coursework. Starting with the Responsive Web course. I decided to use the github to host my projects so people can see them. Some of them need to be runnable, so I had to use other services to host those on. The sections that are empty are not started yet, I will update these as I earn them. If you would like access to the certificates, reach out to me via email or on discord, both are listed on the front page of my profile. You need to have a github account to access them. I am currently working through the sections on FCC and the information for the projects needed to pass the sections isn't fully informative I just wanted to have something in those sections. I will update it as I get to them.

## Responsive Web Design Certification Projects

These are essentially just teaching **NEW** development students **BASIC** `HTML` elements and how the "page" acts. They don't really include everything, but that is in part intentional. The final projects are minimal CSS and HTML and don't really look all that bad imho for being "only" HTML / CSS. It takes about 300 hours of working on the course to get these all done.

## Data Structures & Algorithms Certification Projects

Mainly this course begins by teaching you basic JavaScript types, classes, and variables and then goes onto teaching you how to think about things like looping, and recursion. In the end you will use all of those concepts to builf the final projects needed to pass certification.

## Front End Development Libraries

I am currently working on this section so I will update this as I complete them. This is mainly teaching `Bootstrap`, `jQuery`, `SaSS`, `React.js`, and `Redux`. In the end you will use all of these principles to build the final projects needed to earn the certificate.

## Coding Interview Prep: 

In this section they assume you already know how to code, and are looking to get some exercises and projects you can discplay on your profile. There are links to various sites like ProjectEuler, Rosetta Code, as well as sections named [Take Home Projects](#take-home-projects) where you build projects for your portfolio, and Algorithms that has a list of common programming interview algorithm questions. Other good sites are [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) where you put your programming skills to the test to solve mathmatical problems.
