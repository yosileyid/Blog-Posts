 This is truly such a simple process you should have no issues. Just click "New Repo" on your profile and start the process. Then name it `{username}.github.io` set it to public and click the checkbox to initialize this repository with a README. It will set up an empty repo with a simple readme file in it. Just put whatever index.html file you want in there and push the changes and you will have a website up and running at https://{username}.github.io. Once you have done that you can head over to the ["Using A Custom Domain With Github Pages"]() post and go through that one. Github pages has many "Actions" enabled and you can choose from a few different environments to have your site running on. Jekyll is a common choice and is really simple to set up. As always, reach out if you need help.
